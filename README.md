# Open-Circuit-Voltage-Modeling-

This project focuses on modeling the Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) of a lithium-ion
battery using data collected from a cylindrical Li-ion cell. OCV modeling is a vital
component in battery management systems (BMS), as it enables accurate State of Charge
(SOC) estimationâ€”critical for assessing battery performance, efficiency, and lifespan.
MATLAB is used to analyze voltage and current data to develop and assess OCV
models. This analysis aims to identify a suitable OCV-SOC model for accurate SOC
estimation across various operating conditions.
